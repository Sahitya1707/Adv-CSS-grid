DESCRIPTION



Design a single page that might serve as a template for a web site based on a fictitious company logo design of your choice from LogoPond (https://logopond.com/). Use CSS to apply colours, typography and a grid-based-layout that suits the company’s brand and colour scheme. Build your page using either CSS Grid, CSS Flexbox or a combination of both. The use of a pre-built template (paid or free) is strictly prohibited – all CSS and HTML must be your own.



INSTRUCTIONS



Select an interesting logo concept from the collection available at http://logopond.com/
Devise a grid-based-layout that might serve as the primary landing page (or home page) for the above fictitious company.
Construct the grid layout using either CSS Grid, CSS Flexbox, or a combination of both.
Fill the layout template with suitable headings and greeked text (lorem ipsum or a suitable alternative) for body copy to simulate real content. Be sure to credit the designer of the logo or identity that you are using in some creative way.
Focusing on the colour scheme used by the selected logo design, apply appropriate background colours, text colours and font families to the document using CSS.
Your layout may be fixed-width, fluid and/or responsive – your choice.
Exercise restraint when choosing a number of colours and fonts – remember that most often with good design, less is more.
Upload your completed page to a Web server.
Submit all your files and the URL to your work to this Assignment.
Have fun.


TAKE IT FURTHER




Incorporate an interesting global navigation system with imaginary links to other sections of the Web site or application.
Add some CSS Media Queries to serve up a slightly different grid-based layout, suitable to the user's device.
Incorporate some of the best practices promoted by the HTML5 Boilerplate.
Add some simple, but effective JavaScript or CSS-based interaction.
Anything else you can think of to make the page more fun.


SUBMITTING YOUR WORK



Upload the HTML, CSS and any media files to a Web server and then post a URL to the document to this assignment directly. Please also upload a .zip archive that includes your HTML file(s), your CSS file(s) and any media assets.
